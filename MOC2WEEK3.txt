In the daily stand-up, everybody talks about what they worked on, what they are planning to work on, and any impediments they have.
Burn-down and Burn-up charts help the team track the progress of the current sprint.
Scrum is an adaptive model.
Scrum has fixed, time-boxed development cycles called sprints.
The developers/testers ask questions to understand the stories.
The team will select the stories to work on for next iteration (sprint).
The product owner (or equivalent) shares the top priority stories for the sprint.
Either during the meeting or afterwards, developers create tasks to further solidify what work needs to be done and make final a work commitment for the sprint.
The developers/testers provide a high-level estimate for stories.

Organizational Meetings
Sprint Ceremonies
What happened during the Sprint is reported.
Feedback is gathered from stakeholders resulting in additional items added to the product backlog.
A potentially shippable product increment is demonstrated live.
Inform the product owner so he can work with the CEO and if it is still necessary to get this work done in current sprint, it should be discussed with in the team.
When the sprint duration ends.  For example, if sprints are 2 weeks long, then the sprint is complete at the end of those 2 weeks.
Set team direction and synchronize the dayâ€™s activities.
Identify impediments.
Share status information.
Individual team members should be encouraged to demo the work they did.
It is important to follow up on action items the team decided to work on.
Team members should avoid blaming (finger pointing) other team members in the retrospective.
