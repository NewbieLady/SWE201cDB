Between architecture and implementation
Polymorphism
Information hiding
Coupling
Cohesion
Allowing one module to affect the program flow of another via the use of a state message (message coupling)
including functionality which occurs around the same time
inputs, expected output, and an oracle
Failure
software is well-received by the user
Utilize the intern resources to design and develop drivers and stubs, while work continues on critical-path module development
When you run out of time
Developing test cases based on typical user behavior
